## Description

This is a memory (concentration) game - player tries to find a pair of cards which have the same image.

The game board consists of twelve to eighteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of six to nine pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

At the start player selects a difficulty level: 
* Easy - 6 pairs of cards, 5 stars, 3 hints, bonus start for matching 2 pairs in a row
* Medium - 8 pairs of cards, 4 stars, 2 hints, bonus start for matching 3 pairs in a row
* Hard - 9 pairs of cards, 3 stars, 1 hint, bonus start for matching 4 pairs in a row

Once level is selected, game board displays. During the first 5 seconds, the card's symbols are shown to the player. This gives the player time to memorize their position. During this time, the player is not able to interact with the game. Once time is passed, symbols are hidden again and the player can start flipping the cards.

The player flips two cards over to reveal their underlying symbols. If symbols are the same, cards are matched and stay open. If cards do not match, the player loses one star, and cards are flipped over to a hidden position. 

The player can use the hint button, to display the underlying symbol of one random card. The symbol is shown for 1 second, and the card goes back to the hidden position.

The player can receive a bonus star for matching a certain number of pairs in a row. For instance, in an easy level, the player can receive bonus star for matching 2 pairs in a row. Bonus star will not be added if the players already have all stars. 

The game is over when there is no stars left. The game is won when all cards have been successfully matched. Once the game is finished, the player can see game statistics, like time, moves, stars etc. 

The scoreboard allows the player to see statistics of the last 5 games.
